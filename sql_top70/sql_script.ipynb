    "User Bob has 2 followers. Bob is a second-degree follower because he follows Alice, so we include him in the result table.\n",
    "User Donald has 1 follower. Donald is a second-degree follower because he follows Bob, so we include him in the result table.\n",
    "User Alice has 1 follower. Alice is not a second-degree follower because she does not follow anyone, so we don not include her in the result table.\n",
